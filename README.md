# 🛠️ Compiler Construction Project (LL(1) Parsing Focus)

This repository contains practical projects and exercises related to **Compiler Construction** concepts, mainly focusing on **Lexical Analysis (Scanner)** and **Syntax Analysis (LL(1) Parsing)**.

It aims to simulate the first stages of a compiler by building core components manually, providing a deep understanding of how a compiler processes source code.

---

## 🎯 Topics Covered

- **Lexical Analysis**
  - Building a dynamic scanner to tokenize source code.
- **Syntax Analysis**
  - Implementing Top-Down Parsing methods.
  - Focusing on LL(1) Parsing technique.
- **Practical Application**
  - Solving quizzes and exercises related to grammar parsing and table generation.

---

## 📚 Purpose

This project is part of a course assignment for the **Compiler Design** subject.  
It is designed to strengthen the practical understanding of how compilers are built, specifically focusing on:

- Transition from source code to tokens (Scanner).
- Checking syntactic correctness of tokens (Parser).
- Applying parsing strategies like LL(1).

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C++ (You can replace it with the language you're using)
- Git for version control
- Manual construction of parsing tables and grammars

---

## 🚀 How This Helps

By working on this project, you will:

- Understand how programming languages are interpreted and validated.
- Gain hands-on experience in automata theory, parsing tables, and grammar analysis.
- Develop a strong foundation for more advanced topics like semantic analysis and code generation.
